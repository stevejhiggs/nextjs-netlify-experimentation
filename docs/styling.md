# Styling

The styling system is built using a combination of [Chakra ui](https://chakra-ui.com/).

Chakra allows you to style in a modular manner with css automatically restricted to the component you are styling.

## Theming

The `/src/style/theme.ts` file contains the base themes for the site.

## Cssmodule/scss support

If you don't want to use Chakra you can just create css and scss/sass files as you normally would see [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) for details.
