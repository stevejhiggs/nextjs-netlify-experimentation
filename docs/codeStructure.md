# Code structure

The code is broken up into a number of sections, some of which are dictated by next.js itself

## /pages

Contains both [pages](pages.md) and [api endpoints](api.md)

## /pages/api

Contains [api endpoints](api.md) that are file system routed in exactly the same way that normal pages are.

## /src

Contains all the rest of the source code

## /**tests**

Contains all the [tests](testing.md) and test related utility code
